SUGOS make it super easy to controlling robot remotely.

For example, you can control [PLEN][plen_url] robot from web browser.

The way it works is:

1. Tapping button on browser kicks SUGO-Caller methods
2. SUGO-Caller send packets to remote SUGO-Actor via SUGO-Hub
3. SUGO-Actor received a command and drive the robot connected
