SUGOS is consisting of three parts.

+ [SUGO-Hub][sugo_hub_url] - Web server which works as a hub for callers and actors.
+ [SUGO-Actor][sugo_actor_url] - Client works on where functions actually run. 
+ [SUGO-Caller][sugo_caller_url] - Client works on where calls remote actor functions.

Once you declare a function on an actor, the cloud server shares it's signature with callers.
Then, the callers dynamically define functions to wrap remote procedure calling.     

Thus, function like

```javascript
function sayHelloTo(name){ /* ... */}
``` 

on the actor-side cloud be called as

```javascript
sayHelloTo("Liz")
```

from the caller-side.
